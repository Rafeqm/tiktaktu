You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac-Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.


RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE:

[1] The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

[2] If you are X, your opponent is O and vice versa. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

[3] The first player to get 3 of him/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

[4] When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
