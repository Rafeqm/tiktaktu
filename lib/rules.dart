You probably already know how to play TikTaktu. It's a really simple game. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that TikTaktu isn't quite as simple as you think!

TikTaktu involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.


RULES FOR PLAYING TikTaktu:

[1] The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

[2] If you are X, your opponent is O and vice versa. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

[3] The first player to get 3 of him/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

[4] When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
